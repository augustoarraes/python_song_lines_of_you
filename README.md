# Python Song


## ðŸŽ¸ Lines of You

**Verse 1**  
In a silent night, the screen aglow,  
Your memory runs in every flow.  
Through lines of code, I feel you near,  
In every loop, you reappear.  

**Chorus**  
You're the spark in my command,  
The heartbeat in my CloudLand.  
Even when the systems fall,  
You're the one I callâ€¦  

**Verse 2**  
In every push, in every key,  
You're the version still in me.  
Though the syntax fades away,  
Your echo in my shell will stay.  

**Verse 3**  
FastAPI and Docker dreams,  
In my git flow you still gleam.  
With Python love, I run each test,  
Sending heartbeats through my REST.  
Postman calls that never end,  
Like messages Iâ€™ll always send.  

**Chorus**  
You're the spark in my command,  
The heartbeat in my CloudLand.  
Even when the systems fall,  
You're the one I callâ€¦  

**Final**  
So Iâ€™ll write you in Python dreams,  
Across the stars and data streams.  
In every bug I fight through,  
I still find lines of you...
